# Track_bot_2.0

Utilizing Python with ***OpenCV*** and ***MediaPipe*** integration, this project features a robot that locates, tracks, and follows a designated target while continuously measuring its depth using monocular depth perception. Leveraging multithreading for real-time, lag-free performance, the system achieves dynamic tracking and computes a 3-D trajectory of the target object.

Physical Structure. It was a break-through as it involved the safe assembling. 


Take your time:
While working with the tinkering objects like arduino or raspberry Pi modules, we need patience.

**Story behind** Basing on our initial ideas, we had thought of making a Raspberry Pi Turret using open CV. With a 3-weeks work and zero progress, we were able to install open cv in raspberry module with minimal hopes of our project's success. Turned to Arduino and successfully completed the project. Unsuccessful installation of CV in raspberry. Single installation of 
open cv took us 5 - hours with continuous presence. Memory Expansion. We came to know that it is due to shortage of memory
and later we had expanded it. Slow data Transfer. The camera module was not so up to the mark and there was a recognition
and processing lag. Then we had shifted to Arduino and camera became webcam.
